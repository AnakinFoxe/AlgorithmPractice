- Week 1
  - Bubble Sort
    - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)
    - Could be optimized by early cutting off and ignoring already sorted part
  - Insertion Sort
    - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)
    - Could be optimized by ignoring already sorted part
  - Selection Sort
    - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)
  - Merge Sort
    - Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
    - Space Complexity: O(n)
  - Count Inversions
    - Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
    - Space Complexity: O(n)
    - Based on TopDown Merge Sort.
